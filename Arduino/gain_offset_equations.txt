Actual equations for gain and offset if PWM=0 gave minimum outpout and PWM=255 gace max output:
G = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
O = G(-x1) + y1

In this project PWM=0 gives us the max output and PWM=255 gives us the minimum output so we will use the following ones:
G = (x2 - x1)/(y2 - y1)
O = -1*(G(-x1) + y1)
